The application uses an external API to fetch real-time weather data and displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions based on the city entered by the user through a simple app-style interface.

Weather App
Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 3
The Weather App is a Python-based application developed as part of Task 3 of the Oasis Infobyte Internship. This project is designed to provide real-time weather information based on user input and helps beginners understand how to work with APIs in Python. The application fetches live weather data using an external API and displays important weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. It focuses on strengthening core Python concepts along with practical API integration.

Project Overview

Weather information plays an important role in daily planning and decision-making. The Weather App allows users to enter the name of a city and retrieve current weather details for that location. The program connects to the OpenWeather API, processes the JSON response, and presents the data in a simple and user-friendly format. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to interact with real-world web services and convert raw data into meaningful information.

Features

The Weather App includes the following 

features:

City-Based Weather Search:
The application allows users to enter a city name to retrieve current weather details for that location.

Real-Time Weather Data:
Weather information is fetched dynamically using an external API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date results.
Weather Details Display:
The application displays essential weather information including temperature, humidity, and current weather conditions.
Error Handling:
The program handles invalid city names or API-related errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.
Simple App-Style Interface:
The project uses a clean and beginner-friendly interface that simulates a real application model.
Technologies and Concepts Used
Python 3.x:
The primary programming language used for application development.
Requests Module:
Used to send HTTP requests and receive data from the weather API.
Tkinter:
Used to create a simple graphical user interface for the application.
API Integration:
Demonstrates how to connect Python programs with external web services.
JSON Data Handling:
Processes and extracts relevant information from API responses.
How It Works
The user enters a city name into the application.
The program sends a request to the OpenWeather API using the provided city name.
The API returns weather data in JSON format.
The program extracts key weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather condition.
The retrieved information is displayed to the user in a clear and readable format.
If the city name is invalid or an error occurs, an appropriate message is shown.
Outcome
The Weather App successfully demonstrates the use of real-time API integration in Python and provides users with accurate weather information. This project serves as an excellent learning exercise for beginners to understand API usage, GUI development, and error handling. Completing this task helps interns gain practical experience in building real-world Python applications and enhances their problem-solving and programming skills.
